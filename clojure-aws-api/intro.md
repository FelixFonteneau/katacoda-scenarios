# AWS-API With Clojure 

Clojure is a dynamic and functional programming language based on Lisp syntax. 
It is a very efficient tool that allows good abstractions and immutability. 
Moreover, Clojure has a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) that creates a very pleasant execution environment. Since Clojure treats code as data, it is possible to run instantly any code snippet.

The [aws-api](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/aws-api) is a Clojure API that allows easy access to the AWS services. 
It is a good alternative to aws-cli.

In this scenario, you will learn how to include this library as a dependency of your Clojure project and set up the authentication to AWS. Once this is done, we will show a basic use case of the library and you will be able to run a lambda function (serverless computing) and get the result back!
