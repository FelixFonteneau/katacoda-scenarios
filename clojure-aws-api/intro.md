# AWS-API With Clojure 

Clojure with its REPL is a very powerful tool to create scripts and execute automation.
The [aws-api](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/aws-api) allows easy access to the AWS services with Clojure and is a good alternative to aws-cli. 

In this scenario, you will learn how to include this library as dependency of your Clojure project and set up the authentication to AWS. Once this is done, we will show a basic use case of the library and you will be able to run a lambda function (serverless computing) and get the result back!
