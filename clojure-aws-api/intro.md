# AWS-API With Clojure

Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud provider in the marketplace. Very famous, it offers a huge quantity of services for developers depending on their needs. Moreover, the AWS platform provides scalable and cost-effective cloud solutions.

Additionally, Clojure is a dynamic and functional programming language based on Lisp syntax.
It is a very efficient tool that allows good abstractions and immutability.
Moreover, Clojure has a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) that creates a pleasant execution environment. Since Clojure treats code as data, it is possible to run instantly any code snippet.

The [aws-api](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/aws-api) is a Clojure API that allows easy access to the AWS services.
It is a great alternative to aws-cli.

In this scenario, you will learn how to include this library as a dependency of your Clojure project and set up the authentication to AWS. Once done, we will show a simple use case of the library, and you will be able to run a lambda function (serverless computing) and get the result back!
